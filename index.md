### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, I liked lab 2 in its entirety with all its parts as it taught me how to format and structure my code, familiarizing me with c++ when I first started, since it enabled me to correct the formatting myself since I prefer learning that allows me to be more hands-on with the programming side of source code.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Went into depth about the utility and accessibility that functions provide in the application of source code. I was able to understand and create useful functions that were simple, explanatory and most importantly, easy to use for both me and my partner.Went into depth about the utility and accessibility that functions provide in the application of source code.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, I began to get more involved in creating digital images with coding itself, which is interesting to me because I was very curious about how to actually create images like this directly through source code. I became more familiar with using Magick and understanding how colors can be attributed to pixels and how to create custom resolutions while also strengthening my understanding of rows and columns.
